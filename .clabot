  "messageMissingEmail": "Thank you for your contribution and **Welcome to our Open Source Community!**\n\nTo make sure your pull request is successful, we need all our contributors to be identifiable, but we couldn't parse the GitHub details of the following people : {{unidentifiedUsers}}\n\nLuckily, resolving the issue is straightforward and you can resolve it by following the instructions below.\n\n1. Check your git client is configured with a user email `git config --list | grep email`\n2. If the user email is missing, run the following command, substituting with your git commit email address `git config --global user.email email@example.com`\n3. Make sure your git commit email is configured on GitHub by [Setting your Commit Email Address](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address)\n4. Then, amend the authors in your commit history by using `git commit --amend` to change your last commit.\n\nAlternatively, use the slightly more complex `git reset --soft` and `git rebase` to checkout your changes, rewrite the commit history locally and (force) push changes to the downstream branch.\n\nIf you have any issues with the steps above, please email [help@finos.org](mailto:help@finos.org) so we can help you resolve before reviewing and accepting your pull request.\n\nThanks once again for the contribution and understanding.\n\n_cc_ **@finos-admin**"
